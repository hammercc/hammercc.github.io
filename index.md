## About

Led by [Dr Charlotte Hammer](/team/charlotte-hammer/), the IDEA Lab focuses on understanding where and how epidemic and pandemic risks arise, particularly in complex socio-ecological systems influenced by converging global stressors such as climate change, biodiversity loss, political instability, and violence.  

A key aim of our work is to improve the detection and control of outbreaks at their source to prevent local events from becoming large-scale epidemics or pandemics. Drawing on interdisciplinary methodologies and applied epidemiology, we contribute to strategies that strengthen health security in fragile environments, especially in resource-limited and crisis-affected settings.  

## Approach

1. **Methodological**: integration of multimodal, high-dimensional data across quantitative and qualitative domains fusing field epidemiology and systems thinking  
2. **Thematic**: early detection of infectious disease risks in destabilised complex socio-ecological systems  
3. **Translational**: support for outbreak investigations and capacity building worldwide
