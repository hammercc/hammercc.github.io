## About

Led by [Dr Charlotte Hammer](/team/charlotte-hammer/), the IDEA Lab focuses on understanding where and how epidemic and pandemic risks arise, particularly in complex socio-ecological systems influenced by converging global stressors such as climate change, biodiversity loss, political instability, and violence.  

A key aim of our work is to improve the detection and control of outbreaks at their source to prevent local events from becoming large-scale epidemics or pandemics. Drawing on interdisciplinary methodologies and applied epidemiology, we contribute to strategies that strengthen health security in fragile environments, especially in resource-limited and crisis-affected settings.  

## Approach

1. **Methodological**: integration of multimodal, high-dimensional data across quantitative and qualitative domains fusing field epidemiology and systems thinking  
2. **Thematic**: early detection of infectious disease risks in destabilised complex socio-ecological systems  
3. **Translational**: support for outbreak investigations and capacity building worldwide

## Dr Charlotte Hammer

I am an applied infectious disease epidemiologist and public health emergency specialist. In January 2025, I joined the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge and founded the IDEA Lab. As not only an academic but also a public health practitioner, my work is inherently translational. My applied experience spans national and international public health agencies, policy institutions, and humanitarian organisations, including deployments with the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. This practical background enables me to bridge academic research with real-world implementation, facilitating the adaptation and translation of knowledge to support preparedness and resilience against infectious disease threats globally.
