## Dr Charlotte Hammer

<img src="/assets/images/charlotte.jpg" alt="Dr Charlotte Hammer" style="width:60%;">

I am an applied infectious disease epidemiologist and public health emergency specialist. In January 2025, I joined the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge as an Assistant Professor and founded the IDEA Lab.  
My applied experience spans national and international public health agencies, policy institutions, and humanitarian organisations, including deployments with the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.

## Interested joining us
I am always keen to hear from people interested in opportunities within the lab. Current vacancies will be displyed on the University of Cambridge jobs page and linked below. If there are no current vacancies or if you are a prospective student (PhD, MPhil, project) or collaborator please get in touch by email.
