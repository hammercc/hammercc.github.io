## PI: Dr Charlotte Hammer

I am an applied infectious disease epidemiologist, social scientist, and public health emergency specialist. In January 2025, I joined the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge as an Assistant Professor and founded the IDEA Lab.  
My applied experience spans national and international public health agencies, policy institutions, and humanitarian organisations, including deployments with the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.

## Interested in Joining Us?

I am always keen to hear from individuals interested in opportunities within the lab. I am particularly interested in hearing from those applying for postdoctoral fellowships, such as Wellcome or UKRI. I am also open to supervising prospective PhD and MPhil students. Current vacancies are listed on the University of Cambridge jobs page. Potential collaborators are welcome to get in touch by email.
